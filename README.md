# Apple-Picker
Apple Picker is a set of __RoboComp__ components communicating with each other for a drone attaching apples from trees and dropping them in a box. The simulation is executed in `CoppeliaSim` with `PyRep`. Computer vision algorithms from `OpenCV` are used for detecting objetives (tree and apples) and scripts in `python/lua` for sending movement and orientation orders
